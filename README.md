## Phase 1: Service Request Form

### Project Description
Jaspal designed a Data Analytics Platform (DAP) for service request data to enhance the efficiency of service delivery. The project involved ETL processes using AWS Glue, data cleaning, and analysis to identify operational bottlenecks and resource allocation issues.

### Objective
To analyze service request data for 2023 and 2024, enhance operational efficiency, and provide real-time insights into service delivery.

### Dataset
•⁠  ⁠Service Requests 2023: 100 entries including request type, status, timestamps, etc.
•⁠  ⁠Service Requests 2024: 100 entries mirroring the 2023 dataset structure.

### Methodology
•⁠  ⁠ETL using AWS Glue
•⁠  ⁠Data cleaning and standardization
•⁠  ⁠Real-time updates for daily reflection on service handling
•⁠  ⁠Analyzed using Amazon Redshift and Athena for insights

### Tools and Technologies
•⁠  ⁠AWS Glue
•⁠  ⁠Amazon S3
•⁠  ⁠Amazon Redshift
•⁠  ⁠AWS Athena

### Deliverables
•⁠  ⁠Cleaned and structured data for 2023 and 2024
•⁠  ⁠Real-time analysis dashboards
•⁠  ⁠Identified patterns in service requests and response times

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•⁠  ⁠*Objective:* To identify patterns in service requests, response times, and resolution rates.
•⁠  ⁠*Tools:* AWS Glue, Amazon Redshift, Amazon S3, AWS Athena.
•⁠  ⁠*Outcome:* Key insights into operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

### Data Wrangling
•⁠  ⁠*Objective:* To prepare and clean the dataset for analysis.
•⁠  ⁠*Tools:* AWS Glue DataBrew.
•⁠  ⁠*Outcome:* Data cleaning, null values handling, and standardization of request categories.

### Data Protection
•⁠  ⁠*Objective:* To protect data confidentiality and integrity using AWS KMS for encryption.
•⁠  ⁠*Outcome:* Secure storage and access management for service request data.

### Data Governance
•⁠  ⁠*Objective:* To ensure data quality, privacy, and compliance.
•⁠  ⁠*Outcome:* Implemented data quality checks and privacy rules using ETL pipelines.

### Data Monitoring
•⁠  ⁠*Objective:* To monitor resource performance and data integrity.
•⁠  ⁠*Tools:* AWS CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail.
•⁠  ⁠*Outcome:* Real-time monitoring and alerts for resource usage and data access.

## Phase 2: DAP Design and Implementation

### Data Protection
•⁠  ⁠*Objective:* To implement encryption, user management, and data replication.
•⁠  ⁠*Tools:* AWS KMS, Amazon S3, IAM.
•⁠  ⁠*Outcome:* Secure data storage with encryption and backup strategies.

### Data Governance
•⁠  ⁠*Objective:* To maintain data quality and privacy through ETL pipelines.
•⁠  ⁠*Outcome:* Ensured high-quality, reliable data for analysis.

### Data Monitoring
•⁠  ⁠*Objective:* To track resource performance and data integrity.
•⁠  ⁠*Tools:* AWS CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail.
•⁠  ⁠*Outcome:* Comprehensive logging and monitoring for resource management.# data-analyst-jaspal
